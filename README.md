# 2D Physics simulations - Gravity and Elasticity
This is a collection of processing projects simulating physics under different conditions
## Level 1 - Perfect Elasticity
This bouncy ball simualtion allows you to modify the mass and gravity of a ball in no-energy loss conditions:
- Zero Air Friction
- Zero Bounce 
## Level 2 - Rigid Ball
In this level, air friction is introduced and you can control the mass and air friction on the ball
## Level 3 - Elastic Ball
In this level, a spring is used to simulate elasticity
## Level 4 - Squishy Ball
In this level, deformation is added to the ball
